# Comprehensive Poker Glossary

## Range
**Expert:** A distribution of possible hands a player could have in a specific situation based on their prior actions, position, and tendencies. Typically expressed as percentages, combinations, or specific hand groups.

**Novice:** All the possible hands an opponent might have in a given situation. Instead of trying to guess a specific hand, good players think about the full "range" of hands someone might play a certain way.

## Spot
**Expert:** A specific decision point with a unique configuration of variables (stack sizes, positions, previous action, board texture) that requires a tailored strategic approach.

**Novice:** A particular situation in a poker hand where you need to make a decision. Players often discuss "standard spots" that come up repeatedly.

## Board Texture
**Expert:** The structural characteristics of community cards that influence range interaction, including connectedness, suitedness, card distribution, and draw density, all affecting optimal strategy.

**Novice:** What the shared community cards look like and how they might interact with different hands. Boards can be "dry" (few drawing possibilities) or "wet" (lots of possible straights and flushes).

## Expected Value (EV)
**Expert:** The mathematical expectation of a decision, calculated as the sum of all possible outcomes multiplied by their probabilities. The fundamental metric for evaluating decision quality.

**Novice:** The average amount you would win or lose if you made the same play hundreds of times. Positive expected value (+EV) means the play is profitable long-term, even if it doesn't work this time.

## First to Act
**Expert:** The player required to act initially in a betting round, creating an information disadvantage that necessitates adjustments to opening ranges and post-flop strategies.

**Novice:** The player who has to make the first decision in a betting round. This is generally a disadvantage since you have to act without knowing what your opponents will do.

## Last to Act
**Expert:** The player closing the action in a betting round, possessing maximum information advantage and positional leverage for more effective bluffing and value extraction.

**Novice:** The player who makes the final decision in a betting round. This is advantageous because you see what everyone else does before deciding, giving you better information.

## Thin Value
**Expert:** Value betting with a marginally superior hand that expects to be called by a narrow portion of worse hands in the opponent's continuing range, operating at the EV-neutral threshold.

**Novice:** Betting with a hand that's only slightly better than what your opponent might call with. It's "thin" because your advantage is small and there's risk involved.

## ICM (Independent Chip Model)
**Expert:** A mathematical model converting tournament chip stacks to real equity value based on payout structure, requiring significant strategy adjustments particularly when approaching payout thresholds.

**Novice:** A concept in tournaments that calculates how much your chips are worth in actual money based on the prize structure. It explains why protecting your stack becomes more important than accumulating chips as you approach payouts.

## Game Theory Optimal (GTO)
**Expert:** A perfectly balanced, unexploitable strategy derived from equilibrium solutions where neither player can unilaterally improve their expected value by deviating.

**Novice:** A mathematically "perfect" poker strategy that can't be exploited no matter what your opponents do. It involves precisely balanced betting and bluffing frequencies.

## Equity
**Expert:** The percentage share of the pot a hand expects to win at showdown against an opponent's range, calculated by weighted average of all possible outcomes.

**Novice:** Your chance of winning the pot if all cards were dealt and revealed. Usually expressed as a percentage.

## Polarized Range
**Expert:** A bimodal distribution of hands consisting primarily of strong value hands and bluffs, with minimal medium-strength holdings, optimized for larger bet sizes.

**Novice:** Having either very strong hands or very weak hands, but not much in between. When someone bets with a polarized range, they're saying "I either have something great or nothing at all."

## Merged Range
**Expert:** A contiguous distribution of hand strengths including strong, medium, and weak hands, typically employed with smaller bet sizes and in scenarios requiring protection.

**Novice:** Betting with a wide variety of hand strengths including strong, medium, and weak hands without clear separation between them.

## Value Bet
**Expert:** A bet made with a hand that has positive equity against the opponent's calling range, aiming to extract value from inferior hands.

**Novice:** Betting with a good hand because you think your opponent will call with worse hands, making you money.

## Bluff
**Expert:** A bet or raise with a hand having insufficient showdown value, designed to induce folds from hands with greater equity.

**Novice:** Betting or raising with a weak hand to try to make your opponent fold a better hand.

## Semi-Bluff
**Expert:** A bet with a hand that currently lacks showdown value but retains significant drawing equity, combining fold equity with potential future strength.

**Novice:** Bluffing with a hand that's probably not the best right now but has a good chance to improve (like a straight or flush draw).

## Blockers
**Expert:** Cards in your hand that reduce the combinations of certain hands in your opponent's range, strategically altering range construction and bluffing opportunities.

**Novice:** Cards you hold that prevent your opponent from having certain hands. For example, if you hold an Ace of hearts, your opponent cannot have the Ace-high flush in hearts.

## Reverse Implied Odds
**Expert:** The potential future losses incurred when making a marginally correct call but facing difficult decisions on future streets if your hand improves insufficiently.

**Novice:** The risk of losing more money on later betting rounds when you hit your hand but it still isn't good enough to win.

## Implied Odds
**Expert:** The additional future chips expected to be won beyond the current pot when making a mathematically incorrect immediate call with drawing hands.

**Novice:** Extra money you expect to win in future betting rounds if you hit your draw, which can justify calling a bet even when the immediate odds aren't sufficient.

## Pot Odds
**Expert:** The ratio of the current pot size to the cost of a contemplated call, used to determine if a call is immediately profitable based on equity.

**Novice:** The relationship between how much is in the pot and how much you need to call, which helps determine if a call is worthwhile.

## Position
**Expert:** A player's relative acting order, particularly in relation to the button, which fundamentally influences optimal strategy through information asymmetry advantages.

**Novice:** Where you act in the betting order. Acting later (in "position") is a huge advantage because you get to see what others do before making your decision.

## Continuation Bet (C-Bet)
**Expert:** A bet made on the flop by the pre-flop aggressor, regardless of hand strength, to maintain initiative and exploit the capped ranges of pre-flop callers.

**Novice:** A bet made on the flop by the person who raised before the flop, continuing their aggression whether the flop helped their hand or not.

## 3-Bet
**Expert:** A re-raise against an initial raise, typically polarized pre-flop and more merged post-flop, significant for constructing balanced ranges.

**Novice:** Re-raising someone who has already raised. Called a "3-bet" because it's the third bet in the sequence (the blinds count as the first bet).

## 4-Bet
**Expert:** A re-raise against a 3-bet, generally indicating a highly polarized range consisting of premium holdings and strategic bluffs.

**Novice:** Raising again after someone has made a 3-bet. Usually indicates a very strong hand, though good players sometimes bluff with a 4-bet.

## Check-Raise
**Expert:** A sequential strategy of checking with the intention of raising after an opponent bets, used to build pots with strong holdings or as a semi-bluffing maneuver.

**Novice:** Checking first, then raising after someone else bets. Often a sign of a strong hand or a bluff designed to look strong.

## Float
**Expert:** Calling a bet (typically a continuation bet) with marginal showdown value or a draw with the intention of taking the pot away on a later street.

**Novice:** Calling a bet with a weak or drawing hand, planning to bluff on later betting rounds if your opponent checks.

## Donk Bet
**Expert:** A lead bet made from out of position by a player who was not the aggressor on the previous street, breaking the conventional check-to-raiser pattern.

**Novice:** Betting into the previous round's raiser instead of checking to them. Often considered a beginner move, though it can be strategically sound in certain situations.

## Balancing Range
**Expert:** Constructing betting, raising, or calling ranges with proportionally appropriate value hands and bluffs to prevent exploitability by observant opponents.

**Novice:** Playing both strong hands and bluffs in similar ways so that opponents can't easily tell which you have.

## MDF (Minimum Defense Frequency)
**Expert:** The minimum percentage of your range that must continue against a bet to prevent the opponent from profitably bluffing any two cards, calculated as: pot size รท (pot size + bet).

**Novice:** How often you need to call or raise against a bet to stop your opponent from being able to bluff you profitably.

## Overbet
**Expert:** A bet sizing larger than the current pot, typically employed with polarized ranges on specific board textures where equity distribution is asymmetrical.

**Novice:** Betting more than the size of the current pot, often indicating either a very strong hand or a bluff.

## Protection
**Expert:** Betting to prevent opponents with significant equity from realizing their equity cheaply, forcing drawing hands to pay appropriately.

**Novice:** Betting to make hands with drawing potential pay to continue, rather than giving them a free card that might beat you.

## Bluff Catcher
**Expert:** A marginal hand with sufficient showdown value to beat the bluffing portion of an opponent's range but loses to their value betting range.

**Novice:** A medium-strength hand that can beat only bluffs but loses to the good hands your opponent would bet for value.

## Leveling
**Expert:** The recursive thought process of anticipating strategic adjustments at progressively deeper levels of thinking (I think that they think that I think...).

**Novice:** Trying to out-think your opponent by considering "I think that they think that I think..." and adjusting accordingly. Can lead to overthinking situations.

## Fold Equity
**Expert:** The additional equity gained from the possibility that an opponent will fold to a bet or raise, a critical component in bluffing calculations.

**Novice:** The value you gain when your bet or raise might make your opponent fold, even if your hand isn't the best.

## SPR (Stack-to-Pot Ratio)
**Expert:** The ratio of effective stack sizes to the pot size, dictating appropriate commitment thresholds and post-flop strategies with various hand types.

**Novice:** The relationship between how much money remains in your stack compared to how much is in the pot. Lower SPRs generally mean you're more committed to the hand.

## VPIP (Voluntarily Put Money In Pot)
**Expert:** A statistical measure of how often a player voluntarily commits chips to the pot (excluding blind postings), indicating baseline playing tendencies.

**Novice:** The percentage of hands in which a player puts money in the pot willingly (not counting when they're forced to in the blinds). A high VPIP indicates a loose player who plays many hands.

## PFR (Pre-Flop Raise)
**Expert:** A statistical measure showing how frequently a player raises before the flop, used alongside VPIP to gauge aggression and positional awareness.

**Novice:** The percentage of hands a player raises before the flop. Comparing this to VPIP helps determine if someone is passive (calling a lot) or aggressive (raising a lot).

## 3-Bet Percentage
**Expert:** The frequency with which a player re-raises an initial raiser before the flop, indicating aggression levels and range construction tendencies.

**Novice:** How often a player re-raises before the flop when someone else has already raised. A higher percentage usually indicates aggression.

## Effective Stack
**Expert:** The smallest stack among active players in a hand, which limits the maximum amount at risk and influences optimal strategy.

**Novice:** The lowest stack size among players in a hand, which limits how much anyone can win or lose on that hand regardless of how many chips they have.

## Range Advantage
**Expert:** Having a distributional edge on a particular board texture, where your range contains proportionally more strong hands than your opponent's range.

**Novice:** When the community cards favor your likely hand range more than your opponent's likely hand range.

## Equity Realization
**Expert:** The percentage of theoretical equity that you're able to capture by showdown, accounting for positional disadvantages and betting patterns.

**Novice:** How much of your hand's "on paper" winning chances you'll actually be able to capture, considering factors like position and how the hand will play out.

## Streets
**Expert:** The distinct betting rounds in a hand of poker, each requiring specific strategic adjustments based on changing equity distributions.

**Novice:** The different rounds of betting in poker: pre-flop (before community cards), flop (first three cards), turn (fourth card), and river (fifth and final card).

## Button
**Expert:** The dealer position, which acts last post-flop and is considered the most advantageous position due to maximum information leverage.

**Novice:** The position of the dealer, marked by a round "button" that moves clockwise after each hand. The player on the button acts last after the flop, which is a significant advantage.

## Under the Gun (UTG)
**Expert:** The first position to act pre-flop, requiring the tightest opening ranges due to vulnerability to 3-bets and positional disadvantage post-flop.

**Novice:** The first player to act before the flop, sitting to the left of the big blind. This is the worst position because you must act first with no information about other players' hands.

## Flop
**Expert:** The first three community cards dealt, establishing the primary texture and equity distribution that shapes subsequent betting rounds.

**Novice:** The first three community cards dealt face-up in the middle of the table, available for all players to use in making their hands.

## Turn
**Expert:** The fourth community card, often significantly altering equity distributions and typically involving larger bets relative to the flop.

**Novice:** The fourth community card dealt after the flop betting round is complete. Also called "Fourth Street."

## River
**Expert:** The fifth and final community card, completing all hands and allowing for final value extraction or bluffing opportunities.

**Novice:** The fifth and final community card. After the river, there are no more cards to come, so you know exactly what your final hand is.

## OESD (Open-Ended Straight Draw)
**Expert:** A drawing hand with eight outs to complete a straight, where either of two ranks at opposite ends would complete the sequence.

**Novice:** A straight draw where either of two ranks will complete your straight (e.g., holding 7-8-9-10 and needing either a 6 or Jack). Has 8 cards that can make your hand.

## Set
**Expert:** A three-of-a-kind made by holding a pocket pair and hitting one additional matching card on the board, disguised and often nutted relative to the board.

**Novice:** Three of a kind made by holding a pair in your hand and matching one card on the board. Valuable because it's hard for opponents to see coming.

## Nuts
**Expert:** The strongest possible hand given the current board, which cannot be beaten regardless of an opponent's hole cards.

**Novice:** The absolute best possible hand at any given point. If you have the nuts, you cannot be beaten.

## Pot Control
**Expert:** A strategy of keeping the pot size manageable with medium-strength hands by checking or calling rather than betting or raising.

**Novice:** Deliberately keeping the pot small when you have a decent but not great hand, usually by checking instead of betting or by calling instead of raising.

## Triple Barrel
**Expert:** Firing three consecutive bets on the flop, turn, and river, typically representing a strong hand but sometimes executed as a multi-street bluff.

**Novice:** Betting on all three post-flop rounds (flop, turn, and river), showing consistent aggression throughout the hand.

## Cooler
**Expert:** A situation where two very strong hands develop in the same pot, leading to significant losses for the second-best hand in a way that is unavoidable.

**Novice:** When two players make very strong hands in the same pot (like a full house versus a better full house), resulting in someone losing a big pot with a hand they can't reasonably fold.

## Bad Beat
**Expert:** Losing a pot despite having a statistically favored hand when the money went in, typically due to an opponent drawing to a low-probability outcome.

**Novice:** Losing a hand where you were a strong favorite to win, usually because your opponent hit a lucky card.

## Bankroll Management
**Expert:** The strategic approach to managing poker funds to minimize risk of ruin while maximizing growth potential through appropriate stake selection.

**Novice:** The practice of managing your poker money wisely to avoid going broke, usually by playing at stakes you can afford even if you have a losing streak.

## Variance
**Expert:** The statistical measure of the distribution of results around the expected value, representing the inevitable short-term fluctuations despite correct play.

**Novice:** The natural ups and downs in poker results that happen due to luck, even when playing correctly. The reason why good players can still have losing sessions.

## Bubble
**Expert:** The point in a tournament where one more elimination will put all remaining players in the money, creating significant ICM pressure on short and medium stacks.

**Novice:** The stage of a tournament where one more player needs to be eliminated before everyone else is guaranteed to win prize money. This creates unique strategic considerations.

## Final Table
**Expert:** The last table in a tournament where the highest payouts are determined, often featuring adjusted strategies based on prize structure and stack dynamics.

**Novice:** The last table in a tournament, typically with 9 or 10 players remaining, where the biggest prizes are awarded.

## Cut-off
**Expert:** The position immediately to the right of the button, featuring a wide opening range due to favorable late position dynamics and the ability to steal blinds effectively.

**Novice:** The position one seat to the right of the dealer button. It's the second-best position at the table since you'll act second-to-last after the flop.

## Hijack
**Expert:** The position two seats to the right of the button, representing the transition from middle to late position, allowing for an expanded opening range.

**Novice:** The position two seats to the right of the dealer button. It's considered the start of the late positions, where you can begin playing more hands profitably.

## Lojack
**Expert:** The position three seats to the right of the button (also called "Under the Gun +2" in 6-max games), marking the boundary between early and middle position.

**Novice:** The position three seats before the dealer button. In a full ring game, it's where players typically start opening their ranges a bit wider than early positions.

## Big Blind
**Expert:** The forced bet placed by the player to the left of the small blind, who acts last pre-flop but first post-flop, creating unique defense requirements against steals.

**Novice:** The larger of the two forced bets that begin each hand. The big blind acts last before the flop (which is advantageous) but first after the flop (disadvantageous).

## Small Blind
**Expert:** The forced bet placed by the player to the left of the button, representing the worst position post-flop due to acting first with a precommitted investment.

**Novice:** The smaller of the two forced bets, posted by the player to the left of the button. This is generally the worst position since you act first after the flop and have already invested in the pot.

## Squeezing
**Expert:** Reraising after an open and at least one call, exploiting the capped ranges of callers and leveraging fold equity from multiple opponents.

**Novice:** Making a large re-raise after someone has raised and at least one person has called. This play attempts to "squeeze" out the players in the middle who likely have marginal hands.

## Cold Calling
**Expert:** Calling a raise without having previously invested in the pot, typically requiring a stronger range than defending blinds due to reverse implied odds and positional disadvantages.

**Novice:** Calling someone's raise before the flop when you haven't put any money in the pot yet (as opposed to calling from the blinds, where you already have money invested).

## Double Barrel
**Expert:** Firing a second round of aggression on the turn after betting the flop, applying pressure to marginal made hands and draws.

**Novice:** Betting on the turn after already betting on the flop, continuing to show aggression through two consecutive betting rounds.

## Delayed C-bet
**Expert:** Checking the flop as the pre-flop aggressor, then betting on the turn, often to induce bluffs or build a pot against slow-played strong hands.

**Novice:** When the pre-flop raiser checks on the flop, then bets on the turn. This can make your hand look weaker than it is or allow you to control the pot size.

## Monotone Board
**Expert:** A flop containing three cards of the same suit, creating unique range interaction dynamics, polarized betting patterns, and complex equity calculations.

**Novice:** When all three cards on the flop are the same suit, making flush draws and completed flushes important considerations.

## Rainbow Board
**Expert:** A board containing three different suits, minimizing flush draw possibilities and often creating more stable equity distributions between ranges.

**Novice:** When all the cards on the board are different suits, meaning no flush can be made using just the community cards.

## Paired Board
**Expert:** A board containing at least one pair among the community cards, reducing the combinations of possible sets and modifying straight possibilities.

**Novice:** When the board has a pair (like A-A-7), which changes what kinds of hands are likely to be strong and reduces the chances of someone having three-of-a-kind.

## Dry Board
**Expert:** A board with minimal draw potential, few connecting cards, and typically one high card, leading to relatively static equity distributions.

**Novice:** A board with few drawing possibilities like straights or flushes. Usually these boards favor the player with the strongest made hand.

## Wet Board
**Expert:** A board rich in drawing possibilities, connected cards, and multiple flush possibilities, creating dynamic equity distributions that shift significantly with future cards.

**Novice:** A board with many possible draws to straights and flushes. These boards create more action because many players will have drawing hands with a chance to improve.

## Static Board
**Expert:** A board where equity distributions between ranges remain relatively unchanged across future streets, typically featuring unconnected, unpaired cards.

**Novice:** A board where having the best hand now means you'll likely have the best hand at the end. Future cards are unlikely to change who's ahead.

## Dynamic Board
**Expert:** A board where equity distributions are volatile and subject to significant shifts with future cards due to numerous draws and potential completions.

**Novice:** A board where the best hand can easily change as more cards come. Many players might have draws that could become the best hand.

## Nut Flush Draw
**Expert:** A flush draw containing the ace of the relevant suit, ensuring that if completed, it cannot be dominated by a higher flush.

**Novice:** A flush draw with the ace of that suit, giving you the highest possible flush if the draw completes.

## Gutshot Straight Draw
**Expert:** A straight draw requiring one specific rank to complete, offering four outs and typically insufficient immediate odds to call without additional equity or implied odds.

**Novice:** A straight draw needing one specific card in the middle of a sequence (like having 5-7-8-9 and needing a 6). Has only 4 cards that can complete your straight, making it a weaker draw.

## Double Gutshot
**Expert:** A straight draw with two distinct ranks that can complete different straights, providing eight outs and significantly improved drawing equity.

**Novice:** Having two different gutshot straight draws at once, giving you 8 cards that can complete a straight. Much stronger than a regular gutshot.

## Backdoor Draw
**Expert:** A potential draw requiring two specific cards on successive streets to complete, offering contingent equity that influences decision-making despite long odds.

**Novice:** A draw that needs two specific cards to come on both the turn and river to complete. For example, having two hearts on the flop and needing two more for a flush.

## Runner-Runner
**Expert:** Completing a draw by hitting the required cards on both the turn and river, a low-probability outcome that should rarely factor into standard decision-making.

**Novice:** Hitting both the turn and river cards needed to make your hand, a lucky sequence that happens rarely (about 4% with a flush draw).

## Straight Flush Draw
**Expert:** A drawing hand with both straight and flush possibilities, typically offering 15 or more outs and substantial equity even against made hands.

**Novice:** Having both a straight draw and a flush draw with the same hand, giving you many ways to improve and make a strong hand.

## Equity Denial

## Hand Reading
**Expert:** The process of narrowing an opponent's range based on actions taken, physical tells, and historical patterns to inform optimal counter-strategy.

**Novice:** Working out what hand your opponent might have based on how they've played and what you know about them.

## Showdown Value
**Expert:** The equity a hand has when reaching a showdown without improvement, a key factor in determining whether to bet for value, bluff, or check.

**Novice:** How likely your current hand is to win if you check all the way to showdown. Hands with good showdown value don't need to bluff to win.

## Polarization

**Novice:** Betting on the turn after already betting on the flop, continuing to show aggression through consecutive streets.

## River Bluff
**Expert:** A bluff on the final street where, with no more cards to come, the success depends entirely on fold equity rather than potential future improvement.

**Novice:** Bluffing on the river when all cards are dealt and you can't improve further, meaning it works only if your opponent folds.

## Showdown Awareness
**Expert:** The strategic consideration of hands needed for showdown across the distribution of possible runouts when constructing betting and checking ranges.

**Novice:** Understanding which hands you need to keep in your range to reach showdown, rather than turning them all into bluffs.
